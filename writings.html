    <h2>Wordpress</h2>
    <p>
        In the 2012 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), I came across Brian Chen's (who won a gold medal) blog post on the Art of Problem Solving portal,
        depicting the thought process when solving the problems.
        "Oh my god this is so cool, " I thought.
        With the influence (and motivation) by some other friends I started writing blog posts in December 2013. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I <a href="https://anzoteh96.wordpress.com/2013/12/">started off</a> by narrating interesting events (like the Olympiad camps and scholarship camps), 
        and started writing about my thought process in the <a href="https://anzoteh96.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/tournament-of-towns-fall-2013-senior-a-level/">TOT</a>, 
        <a href="https://anzoteh96.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/apmo-2014/">APMO</a> and IMO. There were also some posts coming in series, which are: 
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://anzoteh96.wordpress.com/category/18-month-college-summary/">Experiences at Sunway College</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://anzoteh96.wordpress.com/category/imo-2014/">IMO 2014</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        As I became more comfortable with writing, I also tried to write posts that are more descriptive and reflect my thoughts. 
        My topic of writing also turned from describing an event to summarizing a few events happening to me:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://anzoteh96.wordpress.com/2017/05/01/obsession-does-it-matter/">Recap of my first year at the University of Waterloo</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://anzoteh96.wordpress.com/2016/12/30/green-red-and-white/">First four months at UW: parallel to description of weather</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://anzoteh96.wordpress.com/2016/02/04/restructuring-thoughts-strategies/">When the Malaysian government slashed the overseas scholarship :(</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
     <h2>College Essays</h2>
    <p>
        This will be added later. As a college applicant who have invested substantial amount of time and energy into fine-tuning my college essays, 
        I hope to illuminate future college applicants on some tips to ace this essay component in my own way. 
        Please be patient, and stay tuned!
